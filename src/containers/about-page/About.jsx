        </h1>
        <p>
          Hello there! I'm excited to share for this small project I've been working
          on – the <span className="freshFruitStore">Fresh Fruits Store</span>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You see, I'm a web developer &#128187;, and this is my way of showing
          off my skills in a practical way &#x1F528;.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Let's get straight to it: the{" "}
          <span className="freshFruitStore">
            <span className="freshFruitStore">Fresh Fruits Store</span>
          </span>{" "}
          is an online shop that specializes in selling fresh fruits.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a niche based online store meant to vend fresh fruits to people
          within my city (Kampala) &#127961;.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I've included some common online store features, like adding items to
          your cart, going through the checkout process, searching for fruits,
          and even getting some recommendations to make your shopping experience
          sweeter. &#128077;
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Why fruits, you ask? Well, Kampala has this incredible array of really
          "fresh" fruits, and it got me thinking – why not bring this goodness
          to people's screens&#128241;?
          <br />
          Not everyone has the time to wander around markets, and I thought this
          could be a handy solution. Shopping online, along with delivery seemed
          like a good idea, especially since the big online players don't deal
          in perishable stuff like fruits.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now, let's talk tech for a moment. I built the{" "}
          <span className="freshFruitStore">Fresh Fruits Store</span>
          primarily using React – It's the one that makes everything run
          smoothly. <br />
          When it comes to styles, I had to choose pure CSS. I know it involved
          quite a bit of coding as people say, but it helped me gain stronger
          grip on the basics.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Vanilla JavaScript has also been an impontant part of the
          construction, because I always had to use it to write my custom
          utility functions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For those fruit descriptions and product info, I got a little help
          from <strong>ChatGPT&#129302;</strong>. It made things easier, though
          sometimes the descriptions did sound a little repetitive.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Out of all the projects so far, I must admit, the{" "}
          <span className="freshFruitStore">Fresh Fruits Store</span>
          holds a special place in my heart &#128149;. It's like seeing a
          project come to life in a way that's both practical and fulfilling.{" "}
          <br />
          It's undoubtedly the one that I admire the most
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So, there you have it – the{" "}
          <span className="freshFruitStore">Fresh Fruits Store</span>, where you
          can explore a virtual fruit haven and shop without leaving your home.
          Thanks for reading! &#128079;
